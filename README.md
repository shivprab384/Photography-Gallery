This project is a personal photo gallery that showcases four unique locations Iâ€™ve traveled to, highlighting my passion for both travel and photography. I created this gallery not just to preserve memories, but to help friends and family who often show interest in photos from my trips. Instead of sending images individually, I can share them all in one beautiful, interactive space.



My goal with this project was to create a simple, meaningful way to document and share my experiences and hopefully inspire others to explore and capture the world around them too. I wanted to put my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills to the test by combining it with some of my interests


Whether you're a fellow traveler, a photography enthusiast, or simply someone curious about new places, I hope this project brings value and sparks your curiosity.


When you open the website, click on each location to see it through my eyes. Some photos in each individual gallery have a short description on the back of the image, which you can view by clicking each photo card!
