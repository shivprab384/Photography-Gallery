This project is a personal photo gallery that showcases four unique locations I’ve traveled to, highlighting my passion for both travel and photography. I created this gallery not just to preserve memories, but to help others who’ve often asked to see photos from my trips. Now, instead of sending images individually, I can share them in one beautiful, interactive space.

My goal with this project was to create a simple, meaningful way to document and share my experiences and hopefully inspire others to explore and capture the world around them too.

Whether you're a fellow traveler, a photography enthusiast, or just someone curious about new places, I hope this project brings value and sparks your curiosity.

When you open up this website click on each location to see those locations through my eyes. Some photos have a description on the back of the image that you can view just by clicking each photo card!
